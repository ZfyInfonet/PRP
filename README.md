# SRP
Simulations about the algorithms of microservice placement with the goal of improving reliability.
  1. ReliabilitySim is the code for the fully protectedjian  path mechanism simulations.
  2. ReliabilitySim_sharedLink is the code for the shared backup path mechanism simulations.
  3. ReliabilitySim_sharedLink_optimal tested the gap between the exhaustive search method and our proposed algorithm.
  4. See the main_customized_topo.py file in each directory to customize the simulation topology. A realistic network topology is pre-provided called NSFNET.
